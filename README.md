# K-Dict
An offline Korean dictionary

# Business
A good dictionary is vital to any student of a language. Our app will provide a basic free dictionary that will suit the needs of most users, while optionally offering in-app purchases for specialized dictionaries.

# Legal 
There are currently no plans to legally protect K-Dict as it is still in the early stages of development. Once a prototype has been created, we will further explore licensing options.

# Technical
The dictionary will initially consist of a web application with MySQL as the database, which will store user information such as search history as well as dictionary entries with fields surch as parts of speech, definition, and example sentences.
